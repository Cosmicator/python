# What is Programming?

Before we start learning the basics of Python, we first need to learn what programming or coding actually means.

For that, we need to understand the meaning of a `Program` , `Programmer` and `Programming` :

- A `program` or `Code` is the list of instructions for a computer to execute.

- A `Programmer` or `Coder` is one who writes the program.

- `Programming` or `Coding` basically means the process of creating instructions for a computer to execute.

Code , Coder , Coding and Program , Programmer , Programming are just the synonyms of eachother.

We use an `IDE` (Integrated Development Environment) also known as a `Code Editor` in order to write any program. A code editor helps programmers to write, edit, and navigate code more efficiently, which can reduce errors and speed up the development of an program.
