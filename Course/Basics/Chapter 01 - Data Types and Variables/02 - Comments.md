# Comments

Comments are descriptions that are added to the code to help explain what the code is doing.

Comments are always ignored by the programming language.

Comments are typically used when the code gets way confusing.

Comments are also used to tell others what a set of code is doing. This is helpful if you want others to edit the code.
