The `Course` is divied into `Chapters` which is furter divided into `Sections` as you can see in the files.

The `Course` also has `Concepts` which is a list of all the topics or concepts covered in this course.

Now before we proceed, keep in mind that each and every particular coding topic is interrealted with eachother. Like, Variables and Functions, etc.

So don't worry if you are not able to understand a particular topic in any section. Just keep on reading the section and proceed to the next section and then come back to the same previous section. That will allow you to understand everything written in this course.

For example, If you are reading the section `03 - Data Types` in chapter `Data Types and Variables` and are unable to understand any particular topic in it then don't stop reading the section, continue it until you complete the section. Then proceed to the next section `04 - Variables` in chapter `Data Types and Variables` and continue reading/practicing it until you complete the section. Then come back to the section `03 - Data Types` in chapter `Data Types and Variables`. This will help you to understand topics which have their definitions explained in further sections/chapters. Hence, we recommend you to note down any particular topic of which you have doubt about in a note and reference it in the `Concepts`.

But keep in mind that while you are referencing your doubts in `Concepts`, you should not get way deeper into the course if you haven't completed the required chapters. It will just overwhelm you with a lot of information to keep up with. Leading you to not understand topics easily or even demotivate you.
