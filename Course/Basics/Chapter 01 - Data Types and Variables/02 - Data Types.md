Before we proceed, keep in mind that variables and datatypes are interrelated. So don't worry if you are not able to understand a particular topic in this section. Just keep on reading this section and proceed to the next section (Variables) and then come back here. That will allow you to understand everything written here.

# Data Types

Data Type specifies the type of data or a value that a variable can hold. Hence the name "Data Type".

For example, if you want the code to print a word or a sentence then you can not write it as `print(a big elephant)`
It will output an error message. Instead you have to write it as:

**CODE**
```python
print("a big elephant")
```

**OUTPUT**
```
a big elephant
```

Here the apostrophe symbol `"     "` represents a **string value** which is a Data Type.

Basically the code knows that you are writting a **string value** if you put the apostrophe symbole at the ends of your words/sentence.
