Before we proceed, keep in mind that variables and datatypes are interrelated. So don't worry if you are not able to understand a particular topic in this section. Just keep on reading this section and proceed to the next section (Variables) and then come back here. That will allow you to understand everything written here.

# Data Types

Data Type specifies the type of data or a value that a variable can hold. Hence the name "Data Type". Some examples of datatypes are: String, Integer and Boolean

- # String

If you want the code to print a word or a sentence then you can not write it as `print(a big elephant)`
It will output an error message. Instead you have to write it as:

**CODE**
```python
print("a big elephant")
```

**OUTPUT**
```
a big elephant
```

Here the apostrophe symbol `"     "` represents a **string value** which is a **Data Type**.

Basically the code knows that you are writting a **string datatype** if you put the apostrophe symbole at the ends of your words/sentence. 

If you do not keep the apostrophe symbols then the code will not understand that you are trying to write a string value and will output an error.

Now, why do we need string? Well, if we ever want to write any alphanumeric values with symbols then we have to use the string datatype.

- # Integer

To output an integer value, we have to use the **integer data type**

As we learned before that in order to write a string value, we need to put apostrophe symbol at the ends of the words/sentence for the code to understand but for outputing an integer datatype we don't need to specify it with any symbols.

An example to out a integer value:

**CODE**
```python
print(5)
```

**OUTPUT**
```
5
```

Now, we can write integers even inside complex datatype (you will learn about this below this integer section)
