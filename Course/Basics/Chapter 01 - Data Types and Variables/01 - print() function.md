# print()

Before we learn about datatypes and variables, we first need to learn about `print()` which is the most basic **built in function** used to print values in the **output**. An example of print() function can be seen here:

**CODE**
```python
print("This is a print statement.")
```

We will be learning about functions in the upcoming chapters.

The resulted output will be:

**OUTPUT**
```
This is a print statement.
```

An **Output** is the information a program produces after processing the input given by the running code.

**Outputs** are usually shown in the output area of an IDE.
