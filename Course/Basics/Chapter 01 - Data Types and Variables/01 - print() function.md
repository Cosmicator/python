Before we proceed, keep in mind that variables and datatypes are interrelated. So don't worry if you are not able to understand a particular topic in this section. Just keep on reading this section and proceed to the next section (Variables) and then come back here. That will allow you to understand everything written here.

# print()

Before we learn about datatypes and variables, we first need to learn about `print()` which is the most basic **built in function** used to print values in the **output**. An example of print() function can be seen here:

**CODE**
```python
print("This is a print statement.")
```

We will be learning about functions in the upcoming chapters.

The resulted output will be:

**OUTPUT**
```
This is a print statement.
```

An **Output** is the information a program produces after processing the input given by the running code.

**Outputs** are usually shown in the output area of an IDE.
