# print()

Before we learn about datatypes, we first need to learn about `print()` which is the most basic **built in function** used to print values in the **output**. An example of print() function can be seen here:
```python
print("This is a print statement.")
```

We will be learning about functions in the upcoming chapters.
The resulted output will be:

**OUTPUT**
```
This is a print statement.
```

An **Output** is the information a program produces after processing the input given by the running code.
