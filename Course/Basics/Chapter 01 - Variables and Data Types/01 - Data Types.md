# print()

Before we learn about datatypes, we first need to learn about `print()` which is a **built in function** which is used to print values in the **output**. An example of print() function can be seen here:
```python
print("This is a print statement.")
```

We will be learning about functions in the upcoming chapters.
The resulted output will be:

```This is a print statement.```
